### ESCAPE THE HAUNTED MANOR

This is a luck based game where you have the choice of trying different rooms for the chance of there being an exit. But before being able to check if there is one, you have to fight a monster! Whether you win or lose is up to fate to decide!

You only have 10 Health Points to spare. You are deducted 3 each time a monster defeats you. The game ends when you run out of Health Points or find the exit.

Good luck!
